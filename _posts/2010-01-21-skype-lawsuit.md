I received an email saying I could possibly recover a whopping FOUR dollars from a class-action lawsuit against Skype (full text below).  I guess people who let their unused Skype credits expire were pissed?  Even though they warned me that they were going to expire, and I let them.  Can I really complain about that?  I&#8217;m glad justice is somehow, somewhere being done, but I don&#8217;t mind that much.  Of course it&#8217;s stupid that they should expire at all, so I guess they should get that message.  It probably would have been better to just reinstate everyone&#8217;s credits.  Cuz you know, computers can keep track of that stuff.  But what I really want to say is:

<Rant about class-action lawsuits>

Do these really help anybody?  I get 4 bucks back out of probably 10 bucks that I let expire.  Is that fair?  What if I only had 30 cents left?  What if I had $200 that I lost?  Do I still get 4 bucks?  Then I would be pissed; but then I probably would not have let them expire.

But in general, I&#8217;ve received a few of these kinds of things before.  Does each of 1,000,000 people getting something back really help anyone?  Or is it just all about punishing the bad company and hoping they don&#8217;t do it again?  Or does it just teach them to screw people more effectively next time, so no lawsuit can happen?  It all just seems dumb.  You can bet the lawyers make a mint, regardless.

Speaking of dumb: Skype, you are.  Your Android app doesn&#8217;t do the 1 thing that made your service cool: allow free calls over the existing internet connection.  I&#8217;m not saying you have to use the wireless internet service (3G or ??)&#8211;though I do believe that should be possible, but theoretically that could be considered a net neutrality thing&#8211;WHY CAN&#8217;T I CALL FOR FREE OVER WIFI?? THAT IS WHAT SKYPE IS FUCKING FOR.

&#8212;

Here is the full text of the lawsuit email I received.  If someone wants my 4 bucks let me know.

&#8212;

NOTICE OF PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION

If you are a United States resident who purchased Skype Credit that, on at least one occasion prior to December 31, 2009, expired after 180 days of inactivity, a proposed class action settlement may affect your rights. PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY.

Plaintiffs Holly Barker and Brian Carness have filed lawsuits against defendants Skype Communications, S.a.r.l. (&#8220;Skype Communications&#8221;), Skype Technologies S.A., Skype, Inc. and eBay Inc., on its own behalf and as successor by merger to Skype Delaware Holdings, Inc. (collectively, the &#8220;Defendants&#8221;) challenging the Skype Credit expiration policy. Plaintiffs allege that Skype User Accounts and Skype Credit constitute &#8220;gift certificates&#8221; that cannot expire or be subject to inactivity fees under various states&#8217; laws and that Defendants unlawfully applied the Skype Credit expiration policy against their Skype Credit balances after 180 days of inactivity in supposed violation of these various states&#8217; laws, including applicable &#8220;gift certificate,&#8221; consumer protection and/or unfair and deceptive practices laws.  
Defendants deny that they did anything wrong whatsoever, and contend that plaintiffs&#8217; claims are meritless. No court has decided which side is right, and both sides have agreed to resolve the cases and provide relief to the Settlement Class instead of litigation. There is a proposed settlement on behalf of a nationwide class of current and former United States resident purchasers of Skype Credit from Skype Communications, which, if approved, will provide that Skype Communications shall discontinue its Skype Credit expiration policy and implement a Reactivation Policy whereby Skype Credit will no longer expire after 180 days of inactivity, but rather be deemed &#8220;inactive&#8221; and subject to reactivation. In addition, Skype Communications, on behalf of itself and the other Defendants, has agreed to pay a Settlement Amount of $1,850,000 in full and complete settlement of the Released Claims, which shall include: (i) attorneys&#8217; fees and costs and named plaintiffs&#8217; incentive awards not to exceed $1,000 each, which collectively shall not exceed 25% of the Settlement Amount subject to Court approval; and (ii) availability, on a claims made basis, of an electronic voucher for $4.00 of Skype Credit per claimant from the Net Settlement Amount.  
If you are a member of the Settlement Class, your legal rights are affected and you have a choice to make right now:
