Well it appears that I managed to migrage from [livejournal](http://ghort.livejournal.com) to wordpress with my posts & comments intact.  LJ&#8217;s export feature sucks (no comments, only 1 month at a time), but I followed these fine instructions from Voices from Catland (!!):[  
](http://ghort.livejournal.com)

Mad props to them, [LJarchive](http://www.fawx.com/software/ljarchive/), and WordPress for making the export/import so easy.  Otherwise I probably would not have done this at all.  I had to touch windows, but otherwise it was painless.
