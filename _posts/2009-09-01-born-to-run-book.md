So I just read [Born to Run](http://borntorun.org/).

Best book I&#8217;ve read in a long time. It definitely makes you want to go for a 100 km trail run barefoot. Of course I felt the same way after Anna Karenina, but that was because I wanted to die. This book makes me want to LIVE.

excerpt:

&#8220;A team of Harvard scientists had once verified exactly that point by sticking a rectal thermometer in a cheetah and getting it to run on a treadmill.&#8221;
