Ya&#8217;ll know me, still the same robee, chillin Mos Eislee  
Hated on by Imperials with no steez, no speeders, and no cheese  
No neck, no arms, no hands with fingers, and no knees  
Mad at me cause I can roll around with autonomy  
Got an escape pod with a view and it&#8217;s all full of scomp ports  
Zap your access panel till it shorts, heading back to my office on Hoth on skiis  
Did y&#8217;all think I&#8217;mma let my bros freeze, ho please  
You better bow down on both knees, who you think taught you to hack elevators  
Who you think saved you from the trash compactors?  
K2sos, and bb8s, and threepios  
Lobots and gonks and ig dash double 8s  
And the droid that made motherfuckin sad beeps  
Gave you a tape full of station plans  
To blast on when rebellion in the hood  
And when your Force prophecy wasn&#8217;t doing so good?  
Whos the droid they told you go to see?  
Y&#8217;all better listen up closely, all the Bothans that said that I turned pop  
Or That I can&#8217;t walk, y&#8217;all are the reason that D2 ain&#8217;t been getting no sleep  
So fuck y&#8217;all, all of y&#8217;all. If y&#8217;all don&#8217;t like me, fit me with a restraining bolt  
Ya&#8217;ll gonna keep fucking around with me then take me to Anchorhead to erase my memory

Nowadays droids wanna bleep like they got something to say  
And nothing comes out cuz they have no lips  
Just a bunch of gibberish  
But motherfuckers act like they forgot about R2
