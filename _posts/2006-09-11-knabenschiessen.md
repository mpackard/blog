Today is Knabenshiessen, a half-day holiday in the Zurich Kanton, for kids to shoot guns. &#8220;[They use a modern rifle like the one they will later be issued in the army.](http://www.myswitzerland.com/en/navpage.cfm?category=Culture&subcat=Customs&id=9027)&#8221; Kids running around with [these](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIG_550)? Man, DNFWCH.

&#8220;If you omit a column name from the column list, Oracle server implicitly inserts a NULL value into that column, provided that column can accept a NULL. If you omit a column that has a NOT NULL constraint, and fail to specify an acceptable value, you receive an error message unless the column has a default value.&#8221;
