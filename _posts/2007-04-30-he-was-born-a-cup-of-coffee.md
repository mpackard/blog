One of the [Princesses of Thailand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chulabhorn_Walailak) came to the university on friday for a symposium. She had an entourage of about 14 people.

[Video](http://www.sf.tv/var/videoplayer.php?videourl=http%3A%2F%2Freal.xobix.ch%2Framgen%2Fsfdrs%2Fts%2F2007%2FTS_27042007.rm%3Fstart%3D0%3A15%3A13.753%26amp%3Bend%3D0%3A17%3A12.132) from the zurich news station coverage (in german).

I installed the red carpet and helped with various logistics, but otherwise had no contact with her, thus missing possibly my only chance ever to high-five a real princess.

Later we went to [Zeughauskeller](http://www.zeughauskeller.ch/english/frame_start.htm) and ate a meter of sausage.
