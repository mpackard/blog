Sometimes it&#8217;s fun to work in a chemistry department.

I just saw a woman walking down the hall holding a styrofoam box with blue smoke billowing from beneath the lid. Her gait said &#8220;I transport harmlessly smoking boxes all the time,&#8221; but the look on her face said &#8220;I better get these baby alien nodules back into stasis before they reanimate.&#8221;

Also, there are occasional explosions.
