A lot of the comments are saying things like &#8220;Starbucks wouldn&#8217;t be so popular if baristas like this guy weren&#8217;t such dicks.&#8221; I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s true; I think it&#8217;s popular because:  
&#8211; They intentially prepare their coffee in a very specific way that makes their coffee taste very dark (i.e. burned). Like McDonalds food can never be mistaken for anything else.  
&#8211; A lot of people seem to care more about familiarity than finding the -best thing- or -unique local thing-. I was shocked to learn that a friend of mine went on vacation and ate at TGIFriday&#8217;s several times. Some people just like to do what they know, not trying unknown things. Also known as the Applebees Effect.  
&#8211; Because it is more expensive than regular coffee.

For me, SB is still the best cafe outside the Uni simply because they are the only smoke-free place in Zurich. Lame.
