Sweet, a 19MB iTunes update. There must be some great new features & functionality!  
&#8220;iTunes 6.0.5 allows you to sync your Nike + iPod workout data to nikeplus.com, where you can easily track your progress, set training goals, challenge others, and much more. Visit the Nike Sport Music area on the iTunes Music Store to download workout mixes, Athlete Inspiration playlists, Nike podcasts, and more.&#8221;  
iTunes, I am so ditching you when Songbird is ready.
