On the last night there we saw an irish band in a pub. A drunk white man who looked like Alan Thicke was making a fool of himself by attempting to dance. After the band was done Karen made the mistake of making eye contact with him. He came over and said something like &#8220;Why are you dressed like that?&#8221; and walked away. Karen was wearing a Jingle Bell Run tshirt and jeans; not unreasonable attire in my opinion.

Galway girls in general wear too much makeup.

Since all I talk about is food, I&#8217;m sure everybody wants to hear about that. Well Ireland pretty much eats only potatoes & meat on the side. Once I had mashed, boiled, and mashed sweet all on the same plate. But man do they know how to cook lamb. And hamburgers, further causing me to believe that Switzerland just doesn&#8217;t understand what a hamburger is supposed to taste like.

Irish men are funny looking. A lot of the medium to older ones are lumpy in unusual ways; I assume it has something to do with the fact that they subsist mainly on alcohol, pork, and fried potatoes. OTOH, all the young guys are totally strapping and lads.

I went running twice. Once I encountered ominous cows and had to turn back. If anything this trip made me take a long hard look in the mirror and wonder how the hell I can be so terrified of pretty much the top 5 most docile animals there are. One morning I had to walk a couple miles in the dark and was certain that I was going to be mauled by rogue night attack sheep.

Thrice I was herded by sheep dogs. Walking into town one day was fairly traumatic just because the dogs followed us all the way in and kept jumping in front of speeding cars. Assuming they do this to more than just us I have no idea how they are still alive. Fifty you hot.

Any given pub was much more comfortable to spend time in than any bar or restaurant I&#8217;ve ever been in with the possible exception of Denny&#8217;s. You can hang out there for hours. The seats are comfortable. The tables are the right height. There is no smoking inside. Hello rest of the world: it&#8217;s not inconvenient to go outside to smoke and it keeps the inside actually tolerable to hang out in and when you leave you don&#8217;t reek. Upon my return to Switzerland I tried to find a smokefree bar but there are none. Am I really the only one who feels this way?

Ah well, I just found out that not everyones hates having to move their hands to the mouse to do anything so I guess I am just out of touch.
