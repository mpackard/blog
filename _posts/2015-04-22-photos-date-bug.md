title: Photos date bug?
date: 2015-04-22

Well, there's something not to like / a bug in the new Apple Photos app:

It appears to use the "modified" file date to determine where to place it in the years view, not "created". Therefore now I have a bunch of pictures taken in 2037.

...

LOL ya'll waited 3+ years for this crushing update.
