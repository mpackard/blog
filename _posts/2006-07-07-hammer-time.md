I don&#8217;t know if it factored into [Mark&#8217;s decision](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/05/30/bye-apple), but the stuff that&#8217;s making me think about ditching apple is just their subtle changes in attitude the last few years.

&#8211; abandoning all of their own ui guidelines,  
&#8211; making itunes more and more like a popup ad for itself  
&#8211; asking me if I&#8217;m going to join shittastic .mac \*twice\* during install  
&#8211; spotlight and dashboard being just really poorly implemented  
&#8211; the finder, it tastes like burning.

You know, the kind of stuff that [John Siracusa](http://arstechnica.com/staff/fatbits.ars/) [writes](http://arstechnica.com/articles/paedia/finder.ars/1) [about](http://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/metadata.ars/1).

In 2001, if any other company had made an mp3 player that you couldn&#8217;t copy your music from, it would have sold about 15 units. Most everyone didn&#8217;t think about it at the time because it was so damn prettyShiny, but the ipod is A PORTABLE HARD DRIVE&#8230; THAT DOESN&#8217;T GIVE YOUR FILES BACK. That any company who claims to make user-friendly products would intentionally create such a device is Off-The-Fucking-Wall-Chex-absurd. In fact, it&#8217;s so insane that it has to have been done on purpose. I&#8217;m not privy to what that purpose is/was (I can guess), but I&#8217;m certain that it&#8217;s not a feature that I&#8217;m going to pay for. Which is pretty sad, because I think the ipod is the best mp3 player I&#8217;ve ever used.

Anyway, it&#8217;s the things like that. The sneaking suspicion that the priorities are changing for the Evil-er. And it is shame because I really like my mac, but it&#8217;s stuff like this that makes me want to just buy a ThinkPad, install some *nix, and just live with the non-lickable ui.

Am I the only one who likes the interface in classic better?
