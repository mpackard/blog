This meme seems random enough to be entertaining:

* Grab the nearest book.  
* Open it to page 56.  
* Find the fifth sentence.  
* Post the text of the sentence in your journal along with these instructions.  
* Donâ€™t dig for your favorite book, the cool book, or the intellectual one: pick the CLOSEST.

&#8212;

&#8220;Other pictures, of horses, of cats deceased but unforgotten&#8211;like &#8220;poor Boobs,&#8221; who had died not long ago and most mysteriously (she suspected poison)&#8211;encumbered her desk.&#8221;

from _In Cold Blood_ by Truman Capote

Rad, my pick includes slight meme recursion. And boobs.
