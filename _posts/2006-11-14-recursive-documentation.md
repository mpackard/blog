Among IBM&#8217;s many crimes, I am amazed at their ability to write hundreds of pages of useless recursive documentation. &#8220;Not familiar with this yet? Go read this other huge book first, then come back and finish this chapter.&#8221; Of course the other huge book contains lines just like this.

It&#8217;s like the old &#8220;If you don&#8217;t understand this, ask your system administrator.&#8221; cop-out. Of course, a normal user would have died hours ago, the only reason I&#8217;m still here is because I \*am\* the sysadmin, you dicks.

Which is really just the adult equivalent of &#8220;Because I said so&#8221; the Official Cop-Out of Parents who can&#8217;t think of a real reason for you not to do something.

Anyway, I always wonder if it&#8217;s a conspiracy to perpetuate the &#8220;charge tons of money for our softare&#8221; -> &#8220;make it too confusing to use so you have to pay for our support and consulting&#8221; -> &#8220;keep our developers & consultants employed&#8221; viscious cycle, but no one could be that sinister, could they? I mean, at some point some developer has got to be like &#8220;Wait, I have to use this crap too?? maybe I should make it easier to use.&#8221;

As opposed to the free software movement, which is:

&#8220;Make it intuitive so you won&#8217;t bug the developer who already has a real job&#8221; Maybe their real job is supporting Websphere, which pays them enough that they can write software in their spare time.

Maybe I should just shut up.
