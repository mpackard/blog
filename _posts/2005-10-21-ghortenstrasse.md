I awake at 10pm after a two-hour dream-infested nap that included riding around Normal on a motocycle GTA-style and talking with Full House characters.  
I suddenly have a craving for sausage.  
Note that I live in a super residential neighborhood that is utterly devoid of restaurants, bars, people, and probably even wolves. During the day I see people walking around, but at night it&#8217;s quieter than Cornell Drive. I am nonplussed. I like saying nonplussed.  
As I walk out the door my mp3 player randomly selects Overkill&#8217;s _Killology_ for me to walk, thus setting the tone for the evening. An evening with Overkill. I take the tram into a more city-center-like-place in an attempt to find Sternen Grill, the brat stand that Anne showed me within hours of my arrival. I have recently learned (15 minutes ago) that it is open until midnight. Sternen has excellect sausage and is the only place I know of to acquire food for less than 10 Swiss Francs.  
I get off the tram and walk along the river, which is awesome. It looks a lot more Euro here than up by where I&#8217;m staying. You know what I mean. For instance, every third shoppe has well-made, fashionable $300 shoes in the window. Now it&#8217;s time to play my new favourite game, How Many Clocks Can I Spot In My Field Of Vision Without Turning My Head. OK, four.  
After walking around and looking at stuff, (Zurich has unfortunately succumbed to the silly Word + Number == posh bar name trend), I find Sternan and get a big-ass sausage, a hunk of bread, and a large glass bottle of beer that I can walk around in the street with because the Swiss aren&#8217;t afraid of glass like America is. Oh and by the way, you know that mustard they have at Kaiserhof, that my dog Fresh had first, with the kit, that&#8217;s kitted out, look like it got frog eyes? Got that shit on dubs. I walk around drinking beer and looking at things.  
At the tram stop a lady in a gaudy sweater asks me something in german. I tell her I don&#8217;t understand. She re-asks me for money, this time in english. Even the homeless people speak english here. Advantage: Switzerland.  
On the way home I see a skateboarder bite it hard. Some things are just hilariously gratifying no matter what country you&#8217;re in.  
&#8212;  
The other day I went to NORDSEE, the Swiss version of Long John Silver&#8217;s. See http://www.nordsee.de/index.jsc for an **international** java experience. Unfortunately it is not pirate-themed.
