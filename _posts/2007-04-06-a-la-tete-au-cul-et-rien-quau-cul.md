Yesterday I had two hours off, today is a holiday, saturday is NOT a holiday, sunday is of course sunday (I think the only officially condoned activies are walking around and sitting silently) AND easter, which I think rules out walking, and monday is a holiday. Saturday is always crazy shopping day for the whole of Zürich; now it will be 5x worse because of the enveloping not-allowed-to-do-anything days.
