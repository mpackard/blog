So ever since I moved to Zurich I&#8217;ve been seeing these Freitag bags &#8212; about 1 in 5 people on the tram have them.  
http://www.freitag.ch/index_frames.php  
I always thought they were kinda tacky looking, especially since they are glossy and trendy looking and look like they get dirty really easily. They have a unique & simplistic look and I can see how people would like them, especially after they became popular.  
Then I was in a store and saw a big display for them. They&#8217;re dirty \*before\* you buy them. Some of them look like they&#8217;ve been dipped in sewage. Now I&#8217;m outraged. WTF is wrong with people &#8212; buying new bags that look trashed. How stupid is that?  
Then I found out that they&#8217;re made from completely discarded stuff &#8212; old lorry tarps, seat belts, and popped bicycle tire tubes. So the dirty is at least  
somewhat legit & justified. So now I still think they&#8217;re kind of ugly, but I want one anyway because they look like nice bags and I dig the fact that they are made from other stuff.  
Then this morning I find out that they cost 200 Swiss francs each. That&#8217;s 153 US dollars. For a fucking recycled plastic bag that I could probably make. Screw you Freitag, you played with my emotions.
