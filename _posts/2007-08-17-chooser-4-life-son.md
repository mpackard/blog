News of AppleWorks nee ClarisWorks being [officially dead](http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/~bob/clarisworks.php). Not that it wasn&#8217;t already because there hasn&#8217;t been an update in forever, but it got me all sniffly for my old G3 powerbook. I had mostly forgotten about AW but it was one of the reasons I switched to mac (before os x even existed). It was the first computer I bought completely with my own money. 2000 bucks&#8211;that was a lot a the time&#8211;I had to get a loan from the bank.

After about 2 weeks I realized that the user interface of OS 9 was way better than win or linux (though comparing macos to  [blackbox](http://blackboxwm.sourceforge.net/blackbox) is a little weird) or solaris, and it&#8217;s still superior to the current OS X interface. Back then they didn&#8217;t have this crazy idea that everything had to look lickable and/or fucking brushed metal and whatever they call this new thing&#8230; brushed dick? Shaded-for-no-reason-porcelin? My itunes is a stylish toilet bowl. OS 9 on my 400mhz powerbook was, for the most part, more responsive and snappy than OS X on my 1.5ghz powerbook. The new intel ones are pretty good but still occasionally laggier than I would like or expect.

Other things that were awesome about that Powerbook:

  * First laptop I ever used that seemed like it could be used for a whole day without breaking your hands or eyes (i.e. good screen & good keyboard; pretty rare in those days. 
      * It was made of plastic and that tough rubbery stuff that thinkpads are covered in. It seemed more solid and durable than current models. 
          * The hinge was such that the screen is not sunk down as far as on the new ones; creating a more favourable viewing angle which is noticible after a while. 
              * You could hold it in one hand without risk of dropping (as opposed to the slippery metal ones). 
                  * It had two bays that could be used for batteries, external drives, etc. You could get like 10 hours out of the thing with 2 batteries. 
                      * Two firewire ports! Remember this back when all other computers had maybe 2 USB v1 ports, so data transfer > 2 MB was a pain in the ass. 
                          * Sleep-on-lid-close and wake-on-lid-open worked perfectly even then. 
                              * Networking just worked. I could move to a different network (wired or wireless) and just pick it up, without rebooting. That was truly unprecedented at the time. And after some recent unsolicited XP experience I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s actually still unprecedented. Combined with the lid thing I had weeks of uptime even though I took it everywhere in my backpack on my bike. </ul> 
                                Anyway, I remember Appleworks fondly as a non-autocorrecting, non-clippy, not-menubar-ridden, simple and responsive wordprocessor/spreadsheet/drawing program. Not too fancy but it had everything a young lad needed to get his compute on. When I had to switch to Word for work I was saddened because Word is slow, expensive, and has about 200 features I don&#8217;t care about. That&#8217;s why I write my journal in vi now. The drawing program was the best; you could quickly make diagrams of anything, which I did ALL THE FREAKING TIME.

                                Excerpt from my journal, written in Appleworks, circa 6 years ago yesterday:
                                
                                Aside: The guy from the Old Main Record Store just came by and said &#8220;It&#8217;s  
                                not as fun as operating a turntable&#8221; is it? What stupid thing to say. Of  
                                course, it&#8217;s the kind of stupid thing \*I\* would say&#8230; I wonder if I&#8217;m going to  
                                end up like that guy. Old and still awkward around people. That&#8217;s what it  
                                is, just being awkward around people.

                                The next computer I buy with my own money will be Linux Thinkpad, methinks.
