The Heart of Illinois Fair came to ZÃ¼rich this weekend, almost entirely unchanged.

Hypnotic rides with strange names & airbrushed 80s pictures (complete with loud rap music blaring!), plenty of mullets, fried dough things, cotton candy (die Zuckarwatte), CARNIES, booths selling wolf/eagle/metal/nascar tshirts & danzig wallets, that FAIR SMELL of mud, sugar, fried meat, livestock, human filth, etc., bad yet fun music, crappy beer tents, an airplane show, fireworks. It was all there.
