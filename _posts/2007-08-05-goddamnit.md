I suddenly have an urge to listen to the Harry Potter audio books. How do I do that? Here&#8217;s how it&#8217;s supposed to work:

1: Go to www.google.com.  
2: Type in &#8220;harry potter&#8221;.  
3: Click on &#8220;I&#8217;m feeling lucky&#8221;.  
4: Click on &#8220;buy the audiobook on mp3&#8221;.  
5: Put it my credit card shit.  
6: Download.

How does it really work?

1: Try steps above; can&#8217;t find mp3s or even link to where i can buy mp3s.  
2: Try itunes: 33 dollars for just the first book and I can only play it on certain computers using Apple&#8217;s crummy client and only when they give me permission? Suck my balls.  
3: Get the feeling this is going to take a while; find about 10 different torrent in 10 seconds on google; start downloading in case nothing else works.  
4: Googling&#8230;.  
5: Find Random House audio book site; they appear to be selling the books on CD for&#8230; $49.95. For 1 fucking book. Suck my balls.  
6: Fuck this, I&#8217;m ranting to LJ and listening to a free NPR podcast or something while the torrent downloads. I&#8217;ve just lost 20 minutes of my life, which is already worth more than the cost of the book even at itune&#8217;s preposterous prices.

Look, people who set this up: I am willing to pay for you simply for the convenience of not having to deal with this bullshit. Sell me your warez properly or I will download them for free.
