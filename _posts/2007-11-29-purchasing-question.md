One time I almost bought a used mini cooper s in florida. They wanted 21k. I decided that the car was worth 18k to me, so I told them that was all I was willing to pay. The manager come out of his office huffing and puffing and saying he would give me 200 bucks if I could find them anywhere for that price, acting very upset. We left. My friend Deb told me she was proud that I made a used car salesman cry.

If a vendor is offering a _buy one, get one free_ sale, does that mean that the margins are high enough for them to make money anyway? Or are they taking a loss just to get a foot in the door?

I&#8217;m inclined to think that they&#8217;re not taking a loss, and I want to say, &#8220;I&#8217;ll just take one for half price.&#8221; Somehow I doubt it will work. I hate equipment negotiation.
