oh man, if this works i would be so happy to dump endnote, the crappy bibliography & reference plugin for word that inexplicably costs 240 dollars

http://www.zotero.org/

but, uh, a firefox extension? weird. i&#8217;m guessing it sucks too, as all bibliography software must, but at least it&#8217;s free.

openoffice is now good enough that i&#8217;ve dumped ms office except to open and re-save .doc & .xls files I have to send to those foolish enough to pay
