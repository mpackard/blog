It snowed for pretty much 24 hours straight; everything in covered in the kind of snow that&#8217;s fun to play in.  
I have a huge bay window that looks up the side of a hill. There are houses, trees, sheep, etc.  
Now that the sun is out and the snow is melting, globs of it are falling off of the various items, especially trees. When looking out the window at nothing in particular, this gives the effect that the world is crumbling to dust.
