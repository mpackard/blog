After the news stories about the [filipino monkey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipino_Monkey) a couple months ago, it occurred to me that recordings of the phenomenon could be what Pressurehed sampled in the song <span style="text-decoration: underline;">dead air</span>. I&#8217;ve always wanted to know what that was from. So far I&#8217;ve found no definitive proof though.
