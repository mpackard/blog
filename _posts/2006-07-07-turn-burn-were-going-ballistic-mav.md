So I was explaining the spell _Turn Undead_ to someone. I&#8217;ve always thought it to be kind of awesomely misnamed, since it does not turn YOU undead, but turns _UN_dead back into _ACTUAL_dead. Or at least turn them away, as one would a Girl Scout Cookie dealer from a different neighorhood (undead or otherwise).

When asked how one &#8220;turns away&#8221; a zombie, it really got me thinking:

Could one turn a Girl Scout Cookie dealer (in the sense of turning them back into a harmless little girl, or turning them _ACTUAL_dead.)

What would a zombie do if turned away? Go to the next house? Rethink it&#8217;s unlife? Cry Real Zombie Tears for the first time since I moved to Switzerland? Nigerian Email-style spam zombie activities?

Can little children in any form be considered harmless? What is my government doing about the mounting threat? Al Gore, where&#8217;s your movie about that, jerkwad?
