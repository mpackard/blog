[TinyUrl](http://tinyurl.com/) is awesome for shortening long links but it&#8217;s annoying that you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re clicking on sometimes.

Normally I look at the bottom line of my browser (Officially known as the Status Bar in Firefox) before clicking on a link to see what I&#8217;m about to get. Often it&#8217;s something descriptive like http://www.ibm.com/some/such/marketing/crap which I know that I don&#8217;t need to click on. But if it&#8217;s just http://tinyurl.com/3dbfym then I have to guess, which can be annoying.

I&#8217;m not worried about being goatse&#8217;d at work, though some people might be.

It&#8217;s good for things where you have to copy and paste a link (like in some documents) or have limited space (like twitter) but it&#8217;s usually unnecessary on a regular old web page. Please make sure you provide context so I know what I&#8217;m about to click on.
