Eclectic Frenchy radio.

http://www.radiodeliro.net/

Music perfect if you:  
&#8211; are taking a bath  
&#8211; having breakfast on a day off  
&#8211; are Amelie

This is the music that, if you&#8217;ve never been to Paris, you assume is piped from unseen speakers as you flit from creperie to cafe to brasserie, saying things like &#8220;Ah, Paris,&#8221; pretending you&#8217;re cool enough to be French.

What is that accordion-y French music called, the music on the free cd you get when you buy a bottle of Red Bicyclette wine, if it came with a free cd?
