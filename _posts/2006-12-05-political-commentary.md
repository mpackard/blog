Last night I had a dream that I was making a video for _Hip Hop Quotables_ with Ludacris in a golden field of wheat under a crisp, clear blue sky somewhere in Georgia. Later in the song we were in and around a really old church, but it didn&#8217;t really look like a church from real life; more like the city of the witch king from Return of the King, except made out of those wooden poles from kids&#8217; playgrounds. Some of them kind of looked like totem poles; i.e. carved and painted with colours like red & green & white on smooth surfaces. In the dream it was a very old, historical church. Inside there was a large open room with green wrought-iron fence across one part. At some point Ludacris and I started cheerfully dancing and lighting the church on fire with torches. As we were leaving I said, &#8220;Hey Ludacris, this is a set right? It&#8217;s not the real church, right?&#8221;

He said, &#8220;Yeah, yeah it is,&#8221; in a calm, completely un-Ludacris-like way.

I said, &#8220;Hey, I don&#8217;t really think we should be burning it down then. It&#8217;s a nice church.&#8221;

He said, &#8220;Yeah, I guess you&#8217;re probably right.&#8221; But it was pretty much too late to do anything about it.

Then I said, &#8220;Hey, aren&#8217;t there still some people inside?&#8221;

&#8220;Yeah, there are,&#8221; he said.

I went back inside to find Dennis Hastert, Pat Robertson, Dan Akroyd, and a couple other suited Republican-looking dudes trapped behind the gate. I helped them get out. On the outside they started criticizing and yelling at me like Bill O&#8217;Reilly & Co. do to people on tv.

I started yelling back and finally got them to shut up by yelling something to the effect of &#8220;I just saved your lives, don&#8217;t you think you could at least \*listen\* to me for just a second?&#8221; Then I started explaining in a somber and well&#8211;frankly&#8211;in a cloying and condescending way about how Jesus was loving and friendly and nice and that they weren&#8217;t following his example. And he wouldn&#8217;t advocate violence against anyone, etc. They appeared to be sorry. Pat Robertson looked at the ground. Akroyd was obviously only acting like a Republican; I don&#8217;t know why he was there.
