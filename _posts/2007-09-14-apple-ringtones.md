DF postulates that &#8220;Clearly, in some way, Apple is beholden to the whims of the music labels with regard to iTunesâ€™s ringtones support.&#8221;

I have no idea if that is true, but it cannot be assumed that the limited ringtone support is solely a result of music business pressure.

Don&#8217;t bother to RTFA, just know that it&#8217;s about apple reaming people for ringtones. If you&#8217;re dumb enough to buy ringtones you deserve your fate.

This is only about the millionth time they&#8217;ve deliberately left out a very obvious feature that I would consider to be a bare minimum for any reasonable product. Can&#8217;t copy your music back off an ipod? All the things that apple CAN charge money for, it will, and it will actively prevent you from going elsewhere. They continue to come down on the side of the &#8220;let&#8217;s make money and restrict access.&#8221; Which is fine I guess but I&#8217;m not going to be a customer, and it leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth for other products i might buy (like their computers, which are generally excellent).

rememeber that letter steve sent about removing drm? why the fuck doesn&#8217;t your software actively block me from doing it myself then? oh yeah cuz you wanted to charge me a dollar.

this is so much of a nonissue that it speaks yet again to apple&#8217;s position about this stuff

jesus fucking christ, just sell me the cd iso for half the price the real cd, stop bugging me about what i&#8217;m going to do with it, and i&#8217;ll be buying 2 a week.

I don&#8217;t understand why this required a huge long article to explain. It&#8217;s just foolish to pay for ringtones for songs you already own.

Also, ringtones have to be one of the least important goddamn issues in the tech world. Why the do I even care?
