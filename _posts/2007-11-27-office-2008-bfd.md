I&#8217;m subscribed to [Mac Mojo](http://blogs.msdn.com/macmojo); a combo blog written by the folks who make Microsoft Office for Mac. I don&#8217;t read it very often because it&#8217;s mostly ads in blog form or some other self-wankery, but today the headline caught my eye:

[Office 2008 for Mac: BFD!](http://blogs.msdn.com/macmojo/archive/2007/11/21/office-2008-for-mac-bfd.aspx)

&#8220;HA!&#8221; I thought. They couldn&#8217;t have expressed my feelings more accurately. Alas, they meant something else: &#8220;BFD! Big Friday Deals. Best Friday Destinations&#8230;&#8221; etc etc. Now that [OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org/) is Good Enough, I don&#8217;t know why anyone would spend money on the MS one.

Yesterday I got to try Office 2007 for Windows, and my first impression was &#8220;Wow, somehow they managed to take up even MORE of my goddamn screen with bullshit menu bars!&#8221; Ctrl-Q. So if 2008 for Mac is anything like that, well, [SMB](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=SMB).
