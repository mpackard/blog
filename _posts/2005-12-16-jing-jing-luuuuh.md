Last night was our department christmas party. It was at this nice restaurant in a big ole house. It was one of the coolest dinners I&#8217;ve ever had for this reason: at my table there was an Albanian girl who grew up in Switzerland, a Swiss guy who grew up in Thailand, a Swiss guy from Switzerland, an Italian, two French, another Italian who is fluent in German, English, and French, a half-Thai half-American girl, and me, from fucking Normal Illinois USA. Once the wine started flowing there were always three conversations going on at once in six different languages. A highlight was when Anne taught everyone &#8220;jing jing luuuh&#8221;, which means something like &#8220;very true!&#8221; or &#8220;WERD!&#8221; in Ghortspeak, so in my head I hear 8 different people all saying &#8220;WERD!&#8221; in their respective accents. Beautiful.

Also, the Europeans are meticulously thorough about cheersing, which takes upwards of 5 minutes with 9 people at the table.
