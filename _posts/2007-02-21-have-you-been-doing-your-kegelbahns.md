Night before last we went to yet another Indian restaurant. This particular one was chosen partly because it was close to Celine&#8217;s apartment, but mostly because its [web site](http://www.maharani.ch/) advertised BOWLING@#(%&, or Kegelbahn as the germans say in german. Apparently it&#8217;s called skittles in britain. Wankers.

skittle |ˈskitl| noun 1 (skittles) [treated as sing. ] a game played, chiefly in Britain, with wooden pins, typically nine in number, set up at the end of an alley to be bowled down with a wooden ball or disk.

1st good sign: From the outside it looks like a seedy 2nd-story Juarez bar where old men drink tequila and wait for Anthony Banderas to come shoot them. 2nd good sign: On the inside there is a floor-to-ceiling sculped banyan tree in the middle of the room and branches with leaves sticking out of walls. It is completely awesome: the craftsmanship and attention to detail impressive; the garishness blatant; the sheer ballsiness of putting a fucking tree in the middle of your restaurant admirable. There is also a carved canoe filled with gourds.

Food was very good and actually spicy which is unusual for Zürich. I&#8217;ll definitely be back to try the&#8230; Exotic Tandoori Ostrich. Wait, OSTRICH!?!

And then the bowling machine in the basement. The Kegelbahn machine is Swiss or German (i.e. HaRD-CoRE), has a pig on it, and is circa 1950s. The mechanism is amazing. Well-designed, yet ancient and mechanical unlike our modern whirleygigs. Rube Goldberg-esque; pullies and pins on ropes and conveyor belts and serious robot light buttons. I thought about how much more impressively designed and built the thing was than any of the enterprise software I&#8217;m forced to use for my job every day.

Crazy wooden balls with HUGE holes cut out of the sides to accomodate hands up to gorilla size. They &#8220;roll&#8221; lumpily and veer sharply if thrown without sufficient force. The atmosphere completed by the tiny your-grandpas-basement-if-your-grandpa-was-indian, 6&#8217;2&#8243; ceilings, cheap boom box, and two cds each containing 1/2 of the soundtrack that they use for all Bollywood movies. It even has the smell down.

PS Celine has done an excellent job of photodocumenting Swiss interestingness lately.
