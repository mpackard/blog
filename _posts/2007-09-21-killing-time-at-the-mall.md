The other day I went to see _Knocked Up_ and there was a guy there wearing an Overkill _Under the Influence_ tshirt. To the girl he was with: you hang on to that one; you got yourself a quality fella.

BTW, _Knocked Up_ is LOLZ, and as Arif said &#8220;Any movie that starts with Wu-Tang has to be good.&#8221; And it&#8217;s got Egon in it.

BBTW, I know that movie probably came out like <del>9 years</del> 284,012,334 seconds ago the US.
