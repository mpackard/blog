At some point I expressed nostalgia for the Muppet Babies, so ADB ordered me dvds of the shows off some website, but they&#8217;re totally bootlegged; the case was made on an inkjet printer, when you put the disc in it just says &#8220;SONY DISC MENU&#8221;, and the video looks like it was recorded in analogue from a vcr.

Train of thought:

  1. It&#8217;s amazing that someone would expend energy bootlegging Muppet Babies to sell on the internet. 
      * The reason someone would do this is that there is a market for it. 
          * I am a part of the illicit Muppet Babies black market. </ol> 
            Attention movie companies: this is how you Make Money On The Internet.
            
            Incidently, the shows are practically impossible to watch due to the high pitched voices of the characters. ðŸ˜€
