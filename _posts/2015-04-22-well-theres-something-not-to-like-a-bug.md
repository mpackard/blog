Well, there&#8217;s something not to like / a bug in the new Apple Photos app:

It appears to use the &#8220;modified&#8221; file date to determine where to place it in the years view, not &#8220;created&#8221;. Therefore now I have a bunch of pictures taken in 2037.

&#8230;

LOL ya&#8217;ll waited 3+ years for this crushing update.
