Man, what I really want is a text-only page that has all my friend notes, blog posts, tweets, twitters, status updates, status upgrades, photos, party invitations, dating/baby/wedding/divorce/settlement announcements, facebook shits, myspace posts (even though I don&#8217;t have an account there), last.fm music history, moodblasted forget-me-nots, everything anyone I&#8217;ve ever cared about&#8217;s google search history, podcasts, slashdot karma, geo-location, geo-cached, geoduck, shit-is-friendster-stillaround?, anything&#8230;

AND the thing is that when I think about all this traffic I know it&#8217;s impossible to keep up with it all anyway. At least if I had that I&#8217;d be able to keep track of metadata such as &#8220;Can we find a correlation between Quarex listening to every Overkill song in alphabetical order and Erik getting engaged to Aqua Teen Hunger Force??&#8221;

I do lament the loss of k-rad aliases though. It&#8217;s not as much fun now that people is using their real names.
