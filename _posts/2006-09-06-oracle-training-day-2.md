Summary of my Oracle Training CD:

&#8220;With Oracle9i, you can fuck a duck using the FUCK\_DUCK function. The Oracle9i FUCK\_DUCK function is used to a fuck a duck and returns the value of the fucked duck in the format that you specify, in Oracle9i.&#8221;

This is accompanied by a Windows 3.1-quality diagram depicting a duck, a green arrow, and an enormous grey cylinder with the word &#8220;database&#8221; next to it.

Following is an interactive slide where I am forced to type something like this:

SELECT duck\_date, FUCK\_DUCK(duck_date,&#8217;fmDDMMYY&#8217;)  
FROM duck_table;

There are about 500 of these.

Every once in a while they mix things up and throw in a little quiz just to make sure I&#8217;m paying attention:

Identify the function that fucks a duck:

A &#8211; FUCK_DUCK  
B &#8211; LOOSE_GOOSE  
C &#8211; DADDY_LONGSHANKS  
D &#8211; RED_GLOWING
