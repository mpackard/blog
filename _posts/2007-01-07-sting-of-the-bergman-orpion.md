Yesterday I saw _The Godfather_ on film for the second time [Filmpodium](http://www.filmpodium.ch/) in Zürich. They show old and foreign movies and have themes such as John Huston (lots of good old Bogart movies), Hitchcock, Afrikaans Month, etc. Right now they&#8217;re showing a bunch of Ingmar Bergman & Al Pacino. Who knew there were Ingmar Berman starring Ingrid Bergman movies? I guess there are a lot of Bergmans in Sweden. I can&#8217;t believe I finally get to see _Glengary Glen Ross_ in the theater.

The first time I saw _Godfather_ was at the [Normal Theater](http://www.normaltheater.com/), which i dearly missed until I discovered Filmpodium. It&#8217;s one of the few things that&#8217;s awesome about Normal; an illustrious list that includes Steak &#8216;N Shake, Abe&#8217;s Carmelcorn Shop (RIP), and Michaeleo&#8217;s Pizza. Again I am baffled that there are four theaters per town showing _The Santa Claus 3_ but I had to go from Normal to San Diego to Zürich before I found another theater that shows old movies.

PS If anyone has a picture of Abe&#8217;s Carmelcorn Shop, please send. It needs to be immortalized in the form of a wikipedia entry. There used to be this guy who always seemed to be working there who was really taciturn and seemed to get annoyed at all the kids that would hang out in his store. I guess I would be pissed too if I had to put up with a million kids in my store who spent so little money there, but if you run or work in a candy store shouldn&#8217;t you be over that?
