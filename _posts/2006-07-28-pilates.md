Don&#8217;t get me wrong, having an octopus head is definitely in the top 5 of Awesome Animal Heads to Have, but I just don&#8217;t understand how cutting out your own heart and putting it in a box earns you immortality, a sailing ship that doubles as an open-air submarine, an awesome pipe organ, and an octopus head. Maybe it&#8217;s just that no one had the brass balls to actually try it before, but wow. I&#8217;ve been dumped before too dude, but it didn&#8217;t make me want to spend the rest of eternity hanging out with a bunch of barnacled assholes on a ship that just goes around ruining everyone&#8217;s day.

Also, no one&#8217;s buying the whole &#8220;so in love with a woman&#8221; excuse either. That dude sets of my gay-octo-dar like a pachinko machine.
