The other night I had a dream that I was hanging out with Tori, whose job was to find and destroy enemy tanks for the army (I think she was just practicing when I was there) using only an Atari-like interface.

I guess that&#8217;s because the last time I talked to her she was writing physics for a tank game, or so I remember. Man that was a while ago.

Of course in between tank killings she was doing like six other things on another terminal.

If anyone has a current email address, please forward to me.
