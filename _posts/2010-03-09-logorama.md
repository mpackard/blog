17-minute animated film&#8230; so fucking cool

[Logorama](http://www.garagetv.be/video-galerij/buzzing_bees/De_kortfilm_der_logo_s.aspx)

First question asked after I put my mouth back on was, &#8220;Did they have to get permission to use all those logos?&#8221;

From <http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2010/03/french-graphic-design-firm-h5-eyes-oscar-glory-with-logorama.html>:

&#8220;Of course not! The film would&#8217;ve been impossible to make if we had waited for permission&#8230;. The film speaks about our current time, and uses the the graphic language of our time. It&#8217;s a kind of time-sensitive snapshot, because in 20 to 30 years, when all of these logos will have been redesigned, the film will be obsolete. So we at H5 said to ourselves that we didn&#8217;t have to ask permission since this isn&#8217;t a commercial movie but rather one whose goal is to show the freedom of expression.&#8221;
