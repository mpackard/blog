The word for cafeteria in Switzerland is &#8220;mensa&#8221;. Ours publishes their menu in german every week, and Babelfish helpfully translates. Some tasty-sounding items include:

&#8211; pouletbruestli in the corn flakesmantel  
&#8211; kraeutermayonnaise  
&#8211; geschnetzeltes schweinefleisch according to kind of inhabitant of zurich  
&#8211; calamares in the paste  
&#8211; daily supplement  
&#8211; sea radish foam  
&#8211; pegususfilet  
&#8211; dorschnuggets  
&#8211; robot hog

Ok one of those is something I apparently said loudly in my sleep.
