Adding a network printer in windows vista is a stupefying experience.

First the _add printer_ wizard asks whether you want to add a local or network printer. Amazingly, you have to choose local, then create a new &#8220;local&#8221; port, which is actually the IP address of your printer.

You then have to choose the appropriate printer driver from a window that has two panes, make and model. Inexplicably, this window is tiny, so it only shows about 4 printers at a time and it IS NOT RESIZABLE. So if you&#8217;re adding, say, an HP printer, you have to slowly scroll through the list of about 700 similarly-named printer models looking for the one you have. Then finally realize that they didn&#8217;t include any drivers for printers that were made in the last 5 years, so you have to go to the manufacturers web site and re-download them manually anyway.

The thing is, this process is \*exactly the same as in windows xp\*. In other words, it \*still\* blows goats, as it has for many years now. No improvement whatsoever.
