I mailed my absentee ballot back to California yesterday; I voted for Obama. Hooray for voting for someone I actually kind of like. I&#8217;m not a 100% zomg-hes-the-bawm; sometimes he seems a little too slick. And being eloquent doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean he&#8217;ll be a good prez either. But he seems relatively honest, sincere, intelligent, and REPASENT ILLINOIS WHAT WHAT@(&%* There&#8217;s really no one else now that Kucinich is out.

It&#8217;s nice to be able to cast a ballot in a race that isn&#8217;t pre-decided. In the 2004 presidential race California was pretty much locked for Kerry, so I didn&#8217;t feel I had to vote for him. I was glad I got to vote for the Green party. I always feel dirty when I have to check that &#8220;I am a democrat and would like to vote in the democrat party primary.&#8221; I found out too late that you don&#8217;t have to do that.
